' Configure PWAD Directory [UI]
' ---------------------------------------
' =======================================
' This class is designed to allow the end-user to customize the
' directory location of where the PWADs are located.
' This program will not do another drastic with this information,
' but merely designed to make life easier for the end-user when
' he or she adds PWADs into their game setup.
' ---------------------------------------




Public Class ConfigPWADPath
#Region "Declarations and Initializations"
    ' This will be available and set when the user selects a new directory that
    ' holds the user's PWAD resources.  This variable is only meant for caching data, but not permanent storage.
    Private newDirectoryRequest As String

    ' This will hold the current (and, if modified) PWAD directory
    '  This will be automatically set when this window is initialized; the
    '  parent window will set this variable in the New() function.
    Public Property PWADPath As String

    ' Exit flag; when the user clicks on either cancel or okay
    ' button, this variable will dictate rather the PWAD path will
    ' be updated or remain as-is.

    '   Cancel = False
    '       Nothing is updated

    ' Constructor Window
    ' ------------------------------------------
    ' This is the default constructor for this window.
    ' This is ideal for transferring data from one end to another.

    ' Parameters
    '   pwadDirectory [String]
    '       Contains the PWAD directory path.

    ' ------------------------------------------
    ' This function will refresh the text box and provide information regarding
    ' the PWAD directory.
    ' If in case the directory was never set or cleared, than try to provide a message
    ' that is understandable to the user - only for presentation sakes.

    ' Select New Directory
    ' ------------------------------------------
    ' This function will allow the end-user to select a new directory that houses their PWADs.  When a new path has been selected, this function will store that path into a temporary variable for other member functions to utilize.  That information is understood to be available when this function returns 'True' to the calling function.  When nothing is selected, no data is kept - but returns 'False'

    '   Because WPF does NOT include an folder browser dialog, like with OpenFileDialog(),
    '   we will have To use the FolderBrowserDialog() from the Forms.
